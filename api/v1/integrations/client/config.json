Sharing flags or solves between teams will lead to immediate disqualification.\n2. **Don't attack the infrastructure.** This includes brute-force attacks and tools that can generate excessive amounts of traffic, such as nmap, dirbuster, etc. unless otherwise specified.\n3. **No flag hoarding or flag dumping!** It's not cool. We require teams to submit flags as they find them.\n\n_Also, don't do anything orange and below on the [CTF tactics iceberg](https://twitter.com/gf_256/status/1206393845497376768/)._\n\n## Sponsors\nThank you to our sponsors:\n- [Google Cloud](https://goo.gle/ctfsponsorship)\n- [Zellic](https://www.zellic.io/)\n- [CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/)\n","sponsors":[],"ctfName":"UIUCTF 2024","divisions":{"open":"Open"},"defaultDivision":"open","origin":"https://rctf.2024.uiuc.tf","startTime":1719619200000,"endTime":1719792000000,"emailEnabled":true,"userMembers":true,"faviconUrl":"https://redpwn.storage.googleapis.com/branding/rctf-favicon.ico"}}
